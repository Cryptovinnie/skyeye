# SkyEye
SkyEye is a transaction analysis tool for the Skycoin Blockchain.
This is currently a work in progress and an initative of the #AusDevBootcamp team.

# The Mission
The Skycoin team are the sole judges of any submissions and will reward bounties for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places based on the following objectives.

## Objectives
Make the best report on stolen coins. Below is a list of deposit addresses to an exchange. Find the dates the coins were sent from the holding/skycoin organization address to the addresses that sent to these addresses:

Report on the following:
1. how many coins total, were deposited into these addresses and sent to the exchanges
2. the date the coins were deposited into these addresses
3. the addresses the deposits came from (sending + change address)

And additionally:

4. track the coins back to the skycoin organization addresses that they were originally sent from
5. the date the coins were sent from the distribution wallets
6. the amount of coins sent
7. the intermediary addresses used and their activity

# Project Team Rules
The work of all contributors will be recognised equally, and all contributors will share in any recognition and bounties equally.

To become an "elegible" participant, you need to be a member of the AusDevBootcamp group and have a PR merged into this repo. The rules may develop further in time, but as we are just staring - this should be sufficient - we want to keep it simple but fair.

This project is primarly motivated by learning - so please have fun and learn. Everything else is secondary.
